The launch of the Online Mode continued your adventure with DedSec London, giving you the opportunity to stop new threats in the Tactical Ops, or to test your mettle against friends in the Spiderbot PVP arena.\n\nSince then, we've expanded the world of Watch Dogs: Legion through a ton of new content in both single player and online.\n\nWe introduced a range of gameplay mode; from fan favourites such as Invasion, to Resistance Mode and a re-imagining of London as a zombie apocalypse with Watch Dogs: Legion of the Dead.\n\nAdditionally, new characters joined the game, like Mina Sidhu, an escaped research subject with mind control abilities, Helen, a retiree with strawberry sweets and a taser in her purse, ready to use either to melt hearts, and Darcy, an Assassin with a strong connection to the London Brotherhood. \n\nThis summer also saw the return of an older Aiden Pearce and Wrench in the story expansion Watch Dogs: Legion -- Bloodline. Set shortly before the events of the main game, the expansion follows them both as they work together to prevent a rising authoritarian threat from a corporate giant, whilst dealing with their own personal motivations, and face old wounds. Continuing their stories, developing Aiden's relationship with his nephew Jackson, and digging deeper into Wrench's motivations was something we were very excited about bringing to the world of Legion, and we've loved seeing the positive reactions from fans.\n\nFinally, thanks to your feedback, we added multiple quality-of-life improvements to the game.\n\nThroughout it all, you've shown us your DedSec teams, favourite recruits, best game moments, fan art, cosplay, videos, and more, and we've loved seeing your content and passion.   \n\nTU 5.6 was our final update for Watch Dogs: Legion. However, you can look forward to reward tracks in the Online Mode, containing both new and returning rewards. The current season 4 *Rebels* track, containing 80 ranks, will run until January 22, 2022, followed by Season 5 *Stripes*. After that, Seasons 3-5 will continue to cycle and return to the game, giving you the opportunity to acquire rewards you might have missed out on in the past. Some rewards to look forward to is a modified version of Aiden Pearce's jacket, and Jackson's mask and clothing set.\n\nThe game has grown by leaps and bounds, with a ton of content to explore, from a sprawling near future city to an action-packed Online Mode.

next major content update that we’re excited to bring to Watch Dogs: Legion. In addition to featuring Darcy and the Assassin’s Creed cross-over event, and the highly requested Invasion PVP, the update will also bring the new Resistance Mode to the game. \n\nBut what is the Resistance Mode? We sat down with Associate UX Director Gregory Kozma to dig into what you can expect from the new feature.\n\n__What is the Resistance Mode and how did the idea of it come about?__\n\nResistance Mode is a challenging new way to experience Watch Dogs: Legion’s single player campaign. \n\nWhen we started working on the Resistance Mode, we took a holistic view at all the systems in the game to see where we could make significant and meaningful adjustments that would dramatically impact the experience for endgame players and create more of a resistance fantasy. \n\n![[WDL] [News] Tea Time with Bagley - Introducing Resistance Mode - Cinematic DedSec On The Run](//staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7EvLfU3bRg3BqEnoPFR7Br/b917c66499751ccd61213d85ac4cdedd/Cinematic_DedSec_On_The_Run.jpg)\n\n__What are some of the changes made to the game when playing in Resistance Mode?__\nOne change that we’ve added is how London’s oppression affects you, the player, and DedSec. In Watch Dogs: Legion, you see how the authoritarian powers affect the lives of others—with Albion in the streets, drones in the skies, ID checkpoints, and people being arrested and detained. With Resistance Mode,we wanted to make sure that the element of the city’s oppression was more felt by players\n\nNavigating around the city with this mode is a lot more dangerous and riskier. Going through an active checkpoint? You’ll get noticed. Are you getting too close to an Albion soldier in the street? You’ll get noticed. Even some of the Tech Points around the world have been trapped by Albion, so grabbing them without a decent plan of escape is a dicey proposition. \n\nSince using the public transit would also be too much of a risk for DedSec, the Underground fast travel system is disabled in this mode.  For fast travel options in Resistance Mode, we focused on expanding the operative swapping system. Not only will all your operatives appear on the map now, but they will also periodically scout out missions, placing themselves close by for a convenient operative swap. We’re really happy about the immersion that this type of fast travel system provides, because there’s more of a sense of playing as a team, and you get additional peeks into the lives of your operatives when you aren’t playing as them. \n\n![[WDL] [News] Tea Time with Bagley - Introducing Resistance Mode - mapicons](//staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6S8SjSLTcbjiyOmBeX6u2M/352aeb954d0f809f735444bbe3c9ac6d/mapicons.jpg)\n\nCombat is even more dynamic. All of the enemies you encounter in this mode are Elites, and they will use their advanced abilities and behaviours a lot more frequently. They’ll also call reinforcements faster, so going in guns blazing stands a much higher chance of getting into hot water. \n\nFor DedSec operatives, we’ve balanced t abilities while ensuring that they still have great impact when used. For example, hack cooldown times have been increased to make their use more strategic, and that gives more room for operatives with the Fast Hack ability, which reduces hack cooldowns, to be felt a bit more.  \n\nFinally, since all of this comes together best when the stakes are high, permadeath is always on in Resistance Mode. \n\n__Multiple Save Game slots on Consoles__\n\nAs we worked on this mode, another feature we wanted to make sure that we brought to our console players was the much-requested addition to save game slots. Two additional save slots have been added in TU 5.5, so now starting a new campaign won’t come at the expense of previous or concurrent playthroughs. You can, of course, use these save game slots for a new, classic campaign as well.\n\nWe're really happy about how this mode has turned out, and we can’t wait to hear players’ thoughts when they try it.\n\nThank you very much to Greg and the team! TU 5.5 and its Resistance Mode launches in late August. \n\nThank you for joining us for this week’s Tea Time With Bagley.

You can read more about what came in Title Update 5.0 [here](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/2352504-Title-Update-5-0-%E2%80%93-Patch-Notes). \n\nSet shortly before the TOAN bombing, the Bloodline DLC brings back Aiden Pearce, Wrench, and Jackson, and follows them as they work together to prevent a new authoritarian threat from a corporate giant. \n\nHow did the art and concept team go about bringing a future look to returning characters? Art Director Patrick Ingoldsby digs into the conception and thought process of recreating Aiden, Wrench, and Jackson. \n\n![Bagley4Picture2](//staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5sD2D8ndPWn7Aw4HeXPFEV/e10f8e0696895c43dd1381497715b095/wdl-news-bagleyblog4-apt.png)\n\nWhen the Bloodline expansion first began development and the characters and story had been outlined, the fun part for our art team was to figure out what Aiden Pearce, Wrench, and Jackson would look like in the near future London of Watch Dogs: Legion. \n\nThe challenge we gave ourselves on the concept team with Aiden and Wrench was to update their look while also respecting the legacy aesthetics that defined them in the past. We tried out a range of ideas, and worked closely with our Narrative and Marketing teams to ensure that the characters would remain visually recognizable at a first glance.\n\n![Bagley4Picture3](//images.contentful.com/p0f8o8d25gmk/4HuaQuFR8aYQ0a2NKw2L7X/27ab9368acf2857395c7aabd7401d86b/Bagley4Picture3.jpg)\n\nAiden, for example, had to be quite a bit older. Many years have passed since we last played him in the windy city, but by this period of his life, he still survives by picking up high-risk jobs and laying low. Laying so low, in fact, and still carrying a deep personal pain, that he’s verging on being on the down and out   . This has kept him physically in shape, even though he’s just tipped past the prime of his life.\n\n![Bagley4Picture4](//staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6WRDGDIevQs4cPFUsXCzQv/a9db2bcbb9eea20916ded0820cf7a9a9/wdl-news-bagleyblog4-cosplay.png)\n\nDespite the years that have passed, Wrench is still a wild card. He comes out of nowhere, complicates matters, and adds his signature delightful element of snarky and ‘explosive’ chaos into the chemistry of our ensembled cast. With this in mind, the concept team wanted to retain the visual notes that his chaotic mind added to his design; the random tattoos, prickly studs, and meme-core art and scribbles on his clothing. But we also added some updates and new-gen refinements. For example, Wrench’s mask emotes have higher fidelity display tech, and the team were able to really push in some gorgeous materials to his leathers and hoodie fabrics. \n\n<center>\n\n![Bagley4Picture5](//images.contentful.com/p0f8o8d25gmk/1WD9n7ZQRyN8F4gqxGXPkz/ca197a281213bf914d2bea122b4abd10/Bagley4Picture5.jpg)\n\n</center>\n\nWhen we started talking about bringing Aiden’s nephew Jackson into the Bloodline story, we quickly realized that he would now be a young man, who would be finishing up his college  education. His age and fiction provided us with a channel to express a more modern near-future aesthetic. He would be more up to date on street sport fashion trends, and he gave us a reason to push on some edgier, forward-thinking designs; going from his hair style, shoes   , and the overall language that was pushed by his fashion style. \n\n![Bagley4Picture6](//images.contentful.com/p0f8o8d25gmk/FItFaMSTnm07kXGTPbONi/c0107eb9a8988230c98adac1febf41d9/Bagley4Picture6.jpg)\n\nContrasting our visual vision for Jackson with Aiden, Jackson’s design was about “pushing towards the future”, while Aiden’s design reflects his struggle with “living in his past regrets”. This is something we also experience in the story of their relationship in the Bloodline DLC. \n\n![Bagley4Picture7](//staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2ZrTGrt7UCPG1KGCN2dHVP/ca63301e04e7d7e41308768f3025e740/Bagley4Picture7_960x540.jpg)\n\nAnother fun part with working on the Bloodline expansion, was conceptualizing the new “rabbit holes” that our teams crafted. With both the new, and the expanded, key locations, we worked to imagine new ways that science could be used in the future; both as a tool of creativity, and as a new form to exert authoritative control. The new locations were a lot of fun to develop and explore out ideas, both for our concept team, and for our level art and design teams.\n\n![Bagley4Picture8](//staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/61vlkQLzLVK15lmSsOr3hZ/a61f0dd475aa03d79bb86d1b7ccd7084/Bagley4Picture8_960x540.jpg)\n\nWe’re very proud of what we’ve created, and it’s been very exciting to see our players’ reactions to the new expansion.\n\nThank you very much to Pat and the rest of the team! \n\nIf you haven’t played through Bloodline yet, you can play it for free as a Season Pass owner, or you can purchase the expansion separately via the in-game store. \n\nThank you for joining us for this week’s Tea Time With Bagley.

In Bloodline, we follow Aiden Pearce as he accepts a routine fixer job in London to reconnect with his nephew Jackson following the events of Watch Dogs, but things go south when Wrench has a different agenda. \n\nWhat was is like bringing Aiden and Wrench to London? What challenges did the team face? We sat down with Team Lead Writer Kyle Francis to talk about the expansion, and how it feels to see a script come to life when mo-cap is being shot. But don’t worry, we won’t spoil the story for you! \n\n__On [Wednesday](https://twitter.com/watchdogsgame/status/1407730357961695232), fans got to see Jackson again, all grown up. Tell us a bit about his character and who’s playing him!__\n\n__Kyle:__ Jackson is a window into what Aiden might have been like as a young man, before he developed the vigilante persona he adopts in Watch_Dogs.  He's brilliant and hot-headed, but fundamentally really sensitive and vulnerable. That's why he puts up the front.  \n\nThat's a lot of nuances to ask an actor to bring to a performance, but it was important that we could always see both aspects of the character - the hardness and the softness. We looked at a lot of great young actors for Jackson, but Munroe Chambers stood out from the first audition tape. When we brought him in to do some scenes with Noam Jenkins, who plays Aiden, it became a pretty obvious choice. Their chemistry was amazing. We really, really lucked out finding Munroe.  \n\n__What were some opportunities and challenges in writing a story that brings Aiden and Wrench together?__\n\n__Kyle:__ Bloodline is, unabashedly, a giant high-five to our players. So the core opportunity, and the core challenge, is embedded right in that premise. On one hand, we knew that we had to give players the opportunity to spend more time with the characters they know and love. On the other, Watch Dogs: Legion takes place over a decade after the original games, and people change a lot in that amount of time. So how do you give people those characters in a way they'll recognize while also trying to be somewhat realistic?  \n\n![TeaTimeWithBagley-BL IMG2](//staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/25BwjjpP997K38fANn4Ak6/ab53cb303438b26ddc3715ad268b65df/TeaTimeWithBagley-BL_IMG2.png)\n\nOur approach is to make the story about that tension. How much have Aiden and Wrench changed since we first met them, how have they evolved as characters? Finding a way to answer those questions in a way that we thought would resonate with the fans - and, I guess, just with people in general - was the thing that excited me the most, and scared me the most, about working on this.  \n\n __What was your favourite moment working on Bloodline?__\n\n __Kyle:__ Easy one. On our first day of shooting cinematics with Noam (Aiden Pearce), Shawn (Wrench), Munroe (Jackson), and Greg (Thomas Rempart, the main antagonist of Bloodline), they all just clicked immediately. Watching them dig into the material and play off each other was so, so cool. Bloodline really has an incredible cast. \n\n __Wrench and Aiden have been absolute fan favorites. How excited were you to be able to bring the characters back for the story expansion?__\n\n__Kyle:__ Very! Watch Dogs: Legion was the first Watch Dogs game I helped write, but I played the first two as a fan. So, getting to work on a story for these characters who I loved was very cool, and very surreal. How is this my job? \n\n__When creating a story expansion like this, with two known characters that have never really interacted with each other, but who meet in a completely different setting than before, how do you approach creating an engaging story that is true to the characters and the previous games?__\n\n__Kyle:__ Speaking for myself: with enormous caution and humility. I know how important these characters are to people, and they're important to me too! The first thing I did was dive into homework. I looked at their fictional biographies, and I replayed both games, but I also looked at what people wrote about them online. I poured over posts and fan art for days. I really tried to understand what people were connecting with, so I could try to write something that would be relevant to them.   \n\nBut there's a nuts-and-bolts, Writing Craft answer to this too. Expanding on my earlier answer, this is why we came up with a scenario that would bring them into conflict with each other. Aiden and Wrench are cosmetically very distinct, they look and sound different, but internally, they have a lot in common. The story is designed to put them both on screen as much as possible and explore that contrast. Which is just kind of an English Lit way of saying that it's really fun to put both characters in a room and watch them annoy the shit out of each other.  \n\n![TeaTimeWithBagley-BL-IMG3](//staticctf.akamaized.net/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7t9l0dAsAUlaVeJXicgYfR/f70d4b0c3e608fd0259cb453ea1298d7/TeaTimeWithBagley-BL-IMG3.jpg)\n\n__How much fun was it to see Noam and Shawn act out the script in the mo-cap studio?__\n\n__Kyle:__ The most fun. Both those guys are very intense, very focused craftsmen on their own, and they bring even more out of each other. They really elevate anything you throw at them. I really can't praise them enough. \n\n__Both characters are older now, things have happened in their life, how did you adapt to that?__\n\n__Kyle:__ Our approach was to tackle that question head-on in the text. The characters needed to be recognizable, or fans wouldn't be satisfied; but they also needed to be different, or the story wouldn't scan. I don't want to go too deep into the details here because this is really the core thematic arc of the story we're talking about, but I can assure you this was top-of-mind for the narrative team. \n\n__When does Bloodline happen in the Watch Dogs: Legion timeline?__\n\n__Kyle:__ It happens between the prologue, but before the main events of the game. __WATCH DOGS: LEGION GAME START SPOILERS:__ Dalton Wolfe is dead, but Sabine hasn't re-activated the DedSec London cell yet.  \n\n__Are you surprised that so many people’s first reaction to Aiden’s new look was to ask if they could shave off his beard?__\n\n__Kyle:__  As a fan of the beard, yes!\n\nThank you very much to Kyle and the rest of the developers to bringing Watch Dogs: Legion Bloodline to life! \n\nIf you’re interested in playing Bloodline on July 6, you have several options: \n\n- It is included in the Season Pass. \n\n- You can purchase Bloodline via the in-game store, separately from the Season Pass. This will allow players who own Watch Dogs: Legion to play through the Bloodline DLC storyline; However, if you buy the Season Pass, you will be able to play through the main game and in Online mode with Aiden and Wrench as your Operatives.  \n\nThank you for joining us for our Tea Time with Bagley.
